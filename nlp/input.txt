Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence.
It helps computers understand, analyze, and process human languages such as English, Spanish, German, and Hindi.
Applications of NLP include chatbots, virtual assistants, translation systems, search engines, and sentiment analysis.

Preprocessing steps are critical in NLP. These include:
1. Tokenization - splitting text into words or sentences.
2. Stopword Removal - removing common words like 'the', 'is', and 'and'.
3. Stemming - reducing words to their crude root form (e.g., 'running' → 'run', 'better' → 'bett').
4. Lemmatization - reducing words to their meaningful root form using grammar rules (e.g., 'running' → 'run', 'better' → 'good').
5. POS Tagging - assigning parts of speech like noun, verb, adjective to each word.

NLP has become extremely important in recent years due to the rise of machine learning and deep learning.
Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon rely on NLP to power applications that improve user experience,
such as voice recognition, recommendation systems, and automatic summarization.
